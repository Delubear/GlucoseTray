    # Sets the previous tag. This will be used in extracting logs in the specific range of tags. Logs are extracted in condition of `${previous-tag}...${current-tag}`. This option decides what tag you'd like to set as the start of the range. You don't need to set this options as usual, but you can set a specific tag whatever you like.

      #previous-tag: # optional
    # Filters tags by this option. This will be used as a parameter of `git tag --list [tag-pattern]`. If this passed with empty string, `git tag` will be executed. It means getting all tags indiscriminately.

    # If scopes are set, this action will only include commit logs with their scopes (others are excluded).

    #core
    #util

    #scopes: # optional
    # This option is for a use case to include commit logs without scopes even if "scopes" option is set.  For example, assume that the following commit logs: - feat(util): add a feature - feat: add a feature - feat(debug): add a feature And assume that the following `scopes` and `include-non-scoped` are set as well: ``` - scopes |
    #util
    #- include-non-scoped: true #``` Then the following release note will be generated. ``` ## Features - feat(util): add a feature - feat: add a feature ```
